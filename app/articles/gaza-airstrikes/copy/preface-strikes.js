                Today, many of the Palestinians living in Gaza will remember their homeland not by the smell of attar
                and incense, or by the salty air of the Mediterranean sea, but by that of blood, scorched metal, rotting
                corpses, and singed flesh. These are the realities of the genocide that Israel has perpetrated on the
                residents of Gaza in response to Hamas’s deadly attack on Oct. 7th, 2023 — which has yielded the most
                death and destruction that the territory has ever seen in its 5,000-year-long history. In a speech given
                on Oct. 7th, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated:
                <br/><br/>
                “All of the places which Hamas is deployed, hiding and operating in, that wicked city, we will turn them
                into rubble … I say to the residents of Gaza: Leave now because we will operate forcefully everywhere.”
                <br/><br/>
                As Egypt and Israel had both closed their borders to Gazans, even civilians who wished to evacuate were
                forced to endure a brutal military campaign. Airstrikes, in particular, have been the most destructive
                element of Israel’s genocide. Amongst other tactics, the bombs dropped on Gaza have arguably dealt the
                most damage; they have killed more than 45,000 Palestinians and reduced over half of Gaza’s buildings to
                rubble.
                <br/><br/>
                Israeli officials have argued that the high number of civilian casualties from airstrikes is a
                consequence of Hamas’s guerilla warfare tactics, such as using human shields, stationing operatives in
                civilian buildings like hospitals and schools, or constructing hundreds of miles of tunnels underneath
                the Gaza Strip. While Hamas has indeed taken advantage of Gaza’s dense population to obscure itself
                amongst civilians and even released videos of its own operatives using some civilian locations for
                military operations, the level of force used by the IDF is still extremely disproportionate, as argued
                by members of the Israeli military themselves.
