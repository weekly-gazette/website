                According to the +972 Magazine, Israel’s airstrikes have several primary goals:
                <br/><br/>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                    <li>Destroying Hamas weaponry and infrastructure, such as rockets, mortars, headquarters, tunnels, and so on</li>
                    <li>Targeting civilian infrastructure to increase “civil pressure” on Hamas</li>
                    <li>Killing Hamas or Islamic Jihad members by targeting their family homes</li>
                    <li>Projecting power to Israeli citizens to raise support</li>
                </ul>
                <br/>
                On the heatmap, you can see which areas have the highest frequencies of bombings, which include central
                cities like Jabalia, Gaza City, and Khan Younis. The IDF has killed high-ranking Hamas members in these
                cities, for example, Mohammed Deif in Khan Younis — who was one of the founders of the al-Qassam
                Brigades. However, the IDF has also targeted sites like refugee camps in Jabalia and thousands of
                residential buildings, indicating their goal of simultaneously expelling Palestinian civilians whilst
                encouraging them to exert pressure on Hamas. According to the +972 magazine, about 50% of the IDF’s
                targets in the first five days after Oct. 7th were public infrastructure and civilian residences.
                <br/><br/>
                Airstrikes are also used in lieu of ground invasions in order to prevent IDF casualties. IDF officials
                have estimated that Hamas has booby-trapped thousands of buildings across the Gaza Strip, but this has
                not been independently verified. If this is the case, that means that airstrikes are a safer option for
                the IDF at the cost of Palestinian civilians’ lives.
                <br/><br/>
                The IDF also may destroy buildings in order to impede the movement of Hamas members and Palestinian
                civilians by creating debris, making it harder for them to travel, access aid, or access other essential
                resources. According to a report by Forensic Architecture, Israel repeatedly struck areas that had
                likely already been destroyed. Land used for agriculture has also been destroyed en masse. As of April
                2025, over 80% of farmland in Gaza had been damaged or rendered unusable by a combination of airstrikes,
                bulldozing, and other methods. In a territory almost entirely sealed off from the rest of the world, the
                consequences of destroying even small amounts of farmland can be deadly for civilians.
                <br/><br/>
                Lastly, airstrikes have been used to bolster support among Israelis. According to Haaretz, the Israeli
                military used airstrikes in tandem with social media in 2021 to garner Israeli support for the war. IDF
                soldiers created fake accounts on Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook, posting images and videos of
                airstrikes to demonstrate the strength of the Israeli military. In summary, airstrikes allow the IDF to
                minimize its human losses whilst advancing its strategic aims and maximizing the damage inflicted on the
                Gaza Strip.

                <Text className="text-2xl font-bold pb-3">How does the IDF choose where to strike?</Text>
                Israeli intelligence uses software called the “Gospel” to plan its airstrikes, which uses AI to
                automatically suggest locations to target. This raises questions about how the AI model is trained and
                how its results are evaluated when used to target Palestinians. Per a former Israeli intelligence member
                interviewed by +972 Magazine: “It really is like a factory. We work quickly and there is no time to
                delve deep into the target. The view is that we are judged according to how many targets we manage to
                generate.”
                <br/><br/>
                Another intelligence member said that “nothing happens by accident .. when a 3-year-old girl is killed
                in a home in Gaza, it’s because someone in the army decided … that it was a price worth paying in order
                to hit [another] target. We are not Hamas. These are not random rockets. Everything is intentional. We
                know exactly how much collateral damage there is in every home.”
                <br/><br/>
                This is especially concerning given that Israel has sufficiently advanced technology to assess the
                civilian risk of airstrikes in the form of the CMHC (Civilian Harm Mitigation Cell). The CMHC divides
                the Gaza Strip into over 600 cells, each of which is updated hourly with population density data
                collated from aerial photography. Despite its existence, a report from Forensic Architecture stated that
                directly after Oct. 7th, Israel consistently targeted areas when more civilians were expected in the
                area. This pattern has continued — as shown in the map above, Israel has also bombed designated safe
                zones repeatedly.

                <Text className="text-2xl font-bold pb-3">How effective are Israeli airstrikes at targeting Hamas?</Text>
                U.S. intelligence estimates that the IDF has killed between 10,000 to 20,000 Hamas militants since 2023,
                with no breakdown on the effect of airstrikes specifically. However, it’s difficult to know either of
                these statistics with certainty because the Gaza Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians
                and combatants.
                <br/><br/>
                Depending on the military objective, airstrikes can be of varying effectiveness. For example, in regards
                to targeting Hamas-built tunnels, an article from the West Point Military Academy stated that bombs
                dropped on Gaza in 2021 only destroyed 100 kilometers of Hamas’s tunnels out of a total of 550 to 700
                kilometers. In addition, to destroy tunnels completely, the IDF would need to use injected TNT or place
                explosives manually in them. The author argued that attempting to destroy all of them is neither
                possible nor particularly advantageous to the IDF, given that not all tunnels are of equal importance.
                <br/><br/>
                In terms of Israel’s goal of completely eliminating the ideology of Hamas, overwhelming airstrikes may
                actually have the opposite effect. As stated by Israeli army spokesperson Daniel Hagari: "Hamas is a
                political party, it is the Muslim Brotherhood, and it has been a group present in the region for years
                and planted in the hearts of people … you cannot destroy an idea; at the political level [Netanyahu's
                government], they must find an alternative to that, or else it will remain.”

                <Text className="text-2xl font-bold pb-3">What tactics does Hamas use to evade airstrikes?</Text>
                There have been numerous accounts of Hamas using civilian structures to hide its military operations.
                The use of tunnels is possibly the most egregious example, given that they run underneath much of the
                Gaza Strip, which is home to over 2.1 million people. However, it’s much more difficult to find
                statistics of how often Hamas uses civilian structures generally, which makes it impossible to
                extrapolate further.
                <br/><br/>
                One notable case occurred in 2014, when a Hamas data center was found underneath an UNRWA facility.
                Additionally, there are reports of Hamas firing rockets from civilian locations, dressing in
                plainclothes to avoid detection, and using schools to store weapons. On Oct. 13th, after Israel issued
                an evacuation order of northern Gaza, Hamas put up roadblocks and instructed civilians not to leave.
                Despite this, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians still fled within the first few several days of the
                order. While the IDF is responsible for each of its airstrikes, Hamas has also contributed to putting
                Palestinian civilians in the crossfire.
                <br/><br/>
                However, even assuming that Hamas uses civilian buildings and human shields on a large scale, this
                strategy is not necessarily effective given that the IDF is willing to bomb civilians disproportionately
                in order to achieve its military objectives. According to the +972 Magazine, there are cases where the
                IDF has approved the killing of almost a hundred civilians in order to eliminate one Hamas military
                commander.

                    How have Israeli airstrikes affected life for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip?
                </Text>
                Airstrikes have been devastating for Gazans. Aside from causing tens of thousands of civilian
                casualties, the damage to Gaza’s infrastructure is enormous. All of Gaza’s universities have been
                destroyed, in addition to most elementary and high school buildings. Most farmland is damaged. Religious
                sites and historical sites have been destroyed, such as the Grand Mosque of Gaza. Only half of Gaza’s
                hospitals are still operational — leaving only 2,000 beds for a population of over 2 million people. As
                a result, many patients have been left to die or are forced to undergo treatment under inhumane
                conditions, such as having limbs amputated without anesthesia. Paired with Israel’s blockade, the
                destruction of critical infrastructure in the Gaza Strip has allowed disease and starvation to ravage
                its inhabitants.
                <br/><br/>
                What’s more, the stress of living in an area constantly bombarded by airstrikes exacts a heavy mental
                toll on Gazans — especially on children. According to a 2019 report by Save the Children, almost 8 out
                of 10 children in the Gaza Strip said that their greatest fear was the noise of aircraft and being
                bombed. Civilians, even if not personally injured, are forced to reckon with the consequences of Israeli
                airstrikes at all times. Journalist Hind Khoudary recounted the Oct. 13th evacuation from northern Gaza:
                <br/><br/>
                “We kept walking. As we walked, pushing each other, we saw bombed cars and dead bodies inside the cars.
                Flies filled the cars, feasting on the blood and the bodies inside.”
                <br/><br/>
                While the IDF’s airstrikes have killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, their true cost extends far
                beyond what can be measured.
