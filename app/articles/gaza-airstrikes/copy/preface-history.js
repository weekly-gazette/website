                old. Walking there, you could just smell the history.”

                “The smell of death is everywhere as bodies are left lying on the roads or under the rubble … In
                northern Gaza, people are just waiting to die … They live from one hour to the next, fearing death at
                every second.”

                The smell of a place is a strange thing to consider. It can’t be written down, captured in a bottle and
                saved for later, or wholly articulated to someone who’s never experienced it themselves. Smells,
                especially those from childhood, have a tendency to burrow themselves deep into the mind, stuck to
                memories that lie dormant until they’re coaxed out by a particularly nostalgic inhale, even years later.

                The Great Mosque of Gaza, perhaps once, smelled of sweet rose attar and incense during the days of the
                Rashidun caliphate, who captured the land from the Byzantines a little over a thousand years ago. Today,
                the mosque smells of smoke and ash, of the Israeli missiles that crumbled its minaret and ground parts
                of its walls down to a fine powder. In the early 5th century, Byzantine traders might have enjoyed the
                aroma of wine en route to Italy or France, while the Assyrians who inhabited Gaza a thousand years
                before breathed air tinged by the scent of copper, and by the musk of donkeys and camels pulling
                caravans west from Iraq to Egypt.
